**Why the pollution index should be included in weather reports**
Air pollution is a prominent issue in several parts of the world such as Bejing, Los Angeles and Sukinda. Smog in the air caused by factories,

This map shows the current concentrations of chemicals in otherwise breathable atosphere everywhere in the world. Local news informing citizens could help spread awareness for air pollution, inform citizens on weather or not filter masks should be warn or even, in extreme circumstances, if outside activity should be limited.

Over time air pollution can be majorly detrimential to respiratory health. Studies show that growing up breathing polluted air can take as many as 15 years off of a person's life.

People around the world deal with the issue of a phenomenon called a TSP or a "total suspended particle" which is a microscopic solid particles floating in the air. Breathing a few parts per million of these pollutants is normal and expected but human production and pollution has greatly increased the presence of TSP's in our atmosphere and causes people to inhale far more than a natural, healthy quanitity.
However, every 100 TSP's can decrease one's life expectancy by 3 years. In some places like China where the average citizen inhales a daily average of 551.6 TSP's which lowers life expexctancy an estimated 15-9 years just from air pollution.

We beleive that this is a serious issue but at the moment there haven't been more than a handful of successful measures taken to reduce the airpolution in high TSP areas. The first step to change is creating awareness and while citizens of these areas are aware that the air isn't clean they arent made aware that the air quality is drastically lowering their life expectancy. We believe that this information should be shared as much as the weather as in a lot of ways its more important and has a bigger impact on people's lives and so we propose that this information be used in weather reports. Tell people when the air pollution is reaching dangerous levels, advise people on when to wear personal air filters, change filters in their homes or buy a portable room filter.
