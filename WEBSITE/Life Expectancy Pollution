People around the world deal with TSP's or "total suspended particle" (minuscule solid particles floating 
in the air, such as pollutants). Having only some in your system isn't bad enough to affect your health critcally.
However, every 100 TSP's can decrease one's life expectancy by 3 years. In some places like China where TSP's can 
reach a daily average of 551.6 TSP's, whereas the south reaches an average of 354 TSP's. Which means if you lived
here your life expexctancy could be dropped by 15-9 years just from pollution. China also, is way over the regulated
legal TSP limit that the US has set in place at 75 TSP'. That was set in place during the Clean Air Act in 1970 
to protect the civilians that were in any given area within the United States.
